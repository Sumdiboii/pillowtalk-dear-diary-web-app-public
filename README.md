<h2>🚀 What Did I Build?</h2>

- Developed **PillowTalk**, a secure and intuitive **MERN stack diary application** designed to help users record thoughts, track moods, and explore their emotional journey.
- Implemented **2-step verification** to ensure privacy and secure access to sensitive diary entries.
- Integrated **sentiment analysis** capabilities to understand user mood and dynamically recommend relevant diary entry templates, enhancing the writing experience.
- Created a robust system for **easy search and retrieval of entries** by date and title, and enabled **upload to cloud drive** for secure backup and data portability.
- Engineered a full suite of **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for seamless management of diary entries and templates.
- Gained practical knowledge in full-stack web development, user authentication, and data privacy best practices.

<h2>📓 What is This Project?</h2>

<p>
PillowTalk is a personal diary application built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**. It's designed to be more than just a digital notebook; it's a supportive space for introspection and self-expression. The project emphasizes user privacy through features like **2-step verification** and offers intelligent assistance via **sentiment analysis** to guide users with relevant writing prompts and templates.
</p>
<p>
I built this application to gain hands-on experience with modern full-stack development, focusing on creating a secure, user-friendly, and emotionally intelligent platform. This project deepened my understanding of how to build scalable web applications, implement robust authentication flows, and leverage data to provide a more personalized user experience in a sensitive domain like journaling.

<h2>🔍 Learning Highlights</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mastered full-stack development with the MERN stack, from database design to UI/UX implementation</li>
  <li>Implemented robust user authentication and authorization, including 2-step verification, to ensure data privacy</li>
  <li>Explored and applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically **Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis**, to personalize user experience</li>
  <li>Developed a comprehensive understanding of CRUD operations for efficient data management</li>
  <li>Gained practical experience in building a secure, scalable, and user-centric web application</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h2>🎯 Future Directions</h2>

<p>
I look forward to integrating more advanced features into PillowTalk, such as AI-powered journaling prompts, enhanced mood tracking visualizations, and cross-platform mobile compatibility. I also aim to explore advanced encryption methods for data at rest and in transit, further strengthening user privacy. The knowledge gained from building this project provides a strong foundation for developing secure and intelligent applications that positively impact user well-being.
